CCA 175 Tips and Exercises

1) Make sure you have high speed internet. I have 18" laptop and it worked fine.
2) Be ready 15 min before as suggested
3) After all the instructions from Proctor (which can take 15-20 min), exam begins. The first screen you see is divided into 3 panes. 1-Q's, 2- Terminal, 3-File selector. Dont get confused here. First read the Q's and then select the first file by clicking on the file selector pane and then increase the terminal size. While solving, increase the terminal size and reduce Q's pane size to half. That way you'll have enough space.  
4) Be prepared so that you read the Q and start answering. Which means all commands and keywords and logic has to be on your fingure tips. No time to think there.
5) While the solution is executed(it could take some time depending on the data) go on to read the next Q. 
6) Solving and practising Itversity videos 1-3 times will prepare you 100%. It's an easy test.
7) Make sure your internet speed is very good. For some questions they give huge datasets i.e 25 million records.
8) Solve all Itversity exercises.
9) File Formats and compression is 90%. Practice all kinds of combinations.
10) Learn spark to hive transfers. I had one Spark-Hive question.
11)I strongly recommend Itversity labs. It gave me much needed cluster practice and the concepts of distributed data. With their Slack support, it'll be easy for Certification and Interview Preparation too!
12) Use only show(5,False) to see data. This will save time. Donâ€™t use show()
